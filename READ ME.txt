There are given 2 task for pcb designing.The schematic files downloaded from
github.com/upsidedownlabs
 
------------------------------------------------
For Task1 feedback given:
------------------------------------------------
1) routing width is larger 
2) jumpers and ports are to be placed at corners.
3) components should be close or placed nearly.
4) silkscreen overlapped.

TASK1 CORRECTED:
1) Routing width has been changed and corrected.
2) jumpers and ports placed at corners.
3) space managed and components placed closely.
4) overlapped text has been adjusted.

NOTE:"SHOWNatTnP" file attached that shown at TnP.
"CORRECTEDtask1" file attached that is corrected before deadline.


-----------------------------------------------
For Task2 feedback given:
------------------------------------------------
1) unconnected wires 
2) all the errors to be fix.
3) although we have enough space for placing components but try to place closely and well arranged.

TASK2 CORRECTED:
1) connected all the connections, using 'place through via' for avoiding shorting wires.
2) routing with care of all errors.
3) components arranged.

For Task2 arrangement of components have taken some reference from downloaded file from "BioAmp-EXG-Pill-main".
NOTE:"ard1" is file name for task 2.
